This plan is all about helping you reach your weight loss goals in a way that’s not just effective, but also enjoyable and sustainable. We’ve got a clear path ahead, and I’ll be here with you every step of the way.

We’re kicking things off by setting a strong foundation. These first few weeks are all about getting into a rhythm that works for you—both in the gym and in the kitchen. You’ll be weightlifting twice a week to keep that muscle while burning fat, and we’ll add in some running to really get your metabolism going. I know you love pasta and sushi, so we’ll keep those in your meal plan, just balanced out to fit your goals. We’re sticking to your intermittent fasting schedule too, making sure your meals are satisfying and keep you energized throughout the day.

As we move into the middle of the program, things will start to ramp up. Your workouts will get a bit more intense, and I’ll be adding some variety to keep things interesting and challenge your body in new ways. We’ll up the ante on your running with some interval training to boost your calorie burn even more. On the nutrition side, we’ll fine-tune your meals—still focusing on foods you enjoy but adjusting portions and ingredients to keep you on track. This phase is where you’ll really start to see the changes in your body and feel the progress.

In the final stretch, it’s all about finishing strong. Your workouts will be tough, but I know you’ve got the strength and determination to push through. We’ll focus on lifting heavier and running faster, really zeroing in on those last few pounds. Your nutrition will be dialed in to support these challenging sessions, with meals timed perfectly to fuel your efforts and recovery. By the end of these 12 weeks, I’m confident you’ll not only hit your target weight but also feel stronger, more energized, and proud of what you’ve accomplished.

Let’s get started and make this your best journey yet!","As we kick off the first four weeks, our focus is on creating a strong foundation that aligns with your weight loss goals. We’re combining weightlifting and running—activities you already enjoy—to help you get into a rhythm that works for you. With two strength training sessions each week, we’ll focus on compound movements like squats and deadlifts, ensuring you maintain your muscle tone while burning fat.

We’ll also add one day of steady-state running to boost your calorie burn and improve your endurance. Starting with a moderate pace for 30-40 minutes will help ease you into the cardio routine without overwhelming your system. Since you’re already active and at an intermediate level, this plan is designed to challenge you just enough while keeping things manageable.

These first weeks are all about consistency and perfecting your form, so you feel confident and strong as we progress. By the end of this phase, you’ll have a solid routine that sets the stage for even greater progress in the weeks ahead. You’re doing great—let’s keep pushing forward and make these weeks count!
