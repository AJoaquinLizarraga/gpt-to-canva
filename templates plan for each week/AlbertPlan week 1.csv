week 1,"As we kick off the first four weeks, our focus is on creating a strong foundation that aligns with your weight loss goals. We’re combining weightlifting and running—activities you already enjoy—to help you get into a rhythm that works for you. With two strength training sessions each week, we’ll focus on compound movements like squats and deadlifts, ensuring you maintain your muscle tone while burning fat.

We’ll also add one day of steady-state running to boost your calorie burn and improve your endurance. Starting with a moderate pace for 30-40 minutes will help ease you into the cardio routine without overwhelming your system. Since you’re already active and at an intermediate level, this plan is designed to challenge you just enough while keeping things manageable.

These first weeks are all about consistency and perfecting your form, so you feel confident and strong as we progress. By the end of this phase, you’ll have a solid routine that sets the stage for even greater progress in the weeks ahead. You’re doing great—let’s keep pushing forward and make these weeks count!
